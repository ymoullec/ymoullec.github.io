This blog contains a history of all the work done by me, ymoullec, during HFOSS@RIT courses.

HFOSS is a courses given by D. Joe Anderson at the Rochester Institute of Technology and stands for Humanitarian Free and Open-Source Software.

All course material and resources can be found on this [GitHub repository][github] and in the [course's wiki][wiki].

This [webpage][HFOSS-link] will evolve throughout the year as I and other participants publish blog posts and contribute to the course.
